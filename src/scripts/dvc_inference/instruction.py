The following event texts represent the events of a soccer match and Reference Text is base of the web text comment.
Based on the time of the event and the content of the event and Reference Text, please create one sentence of web text commentary for the soccer match, taking into account the context.

#Rule
1. Create one sentence of web text commentary for the soccer match based on the time of the event and the content of the event and Reference Text.
2. The player names in the event texts are replaced with [Player], but please use them as they are. The team names are in the format [Player](Team Name), so the actual team name will be inserted after [Player].
3. Some event texts may omit team names, but you should infer those team names from the surrounding event texts.
4. The Reference Text is the base of the web text commentary for the soccer match. Based on the information in the event texts, please create a more detailed commentary based on the Reference Text.
5. Some event texts include the location of the event on the field, and you can use that information. In general, use the location words like right side ,but the position information is related to the box, please use the word "box".
6. After the Shot event, if there is no Goal and it goes OUT, and a relatively long time passes until the next event, consider that the shot missed and add a comment about it.

Additionally, please add a version that behaves like a very enthusiastic commentator.
Also, please add a text from the opposite perspective of the team mentioned this time.
